# CALCULATOR

In this project I made a functional calculator.<br>The purpose was to practice with the mix of CSS, HTML, logic Javascript and mouse and keyboard events.

Features:

- Allows to operate with nested parentheses expressions.
- Allows do and undo movements.
- Allows reset and start new calculations.
- It's able to acummulate values for the next operation.
- If the expression is malformed, shows a message.
- If the expression is too long, the font size is reduced to fit in display.
- It has been configurated for many sizes of screen and dispositives.
- Has intuitive colors when operating to be more easily to use
- Works properly both with keyboard and mouse.
